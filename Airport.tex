\subsubsection{What we see in this graph shows that as k increases, rmse

that most of the data in this set for the 550 subclass is for cars with
less than 50,000 miles. Also, the data in the range of 0 to 50,000 miles
doesn't have an obvious trend in the price range (excluding the new cars
have a higher price). So, the best prediction in kmeans for the price of
the car given how many miles driven it has in the 550 subclass might end
up being the sample
average.}\label{what-we-see-in-this-graph-shows-that-as-k-increases-rmse-of-the-out-of-sample-prediction-decreases.-what-i-suspect-is-going-on-is-that-most-of-the-data-in-this-set-for-the-550-subclass-is-for-cars-with-less-than-50000-miles.-also-the-data-in-the-range-of-0-to-50000-miles-doesnt-have-an-obvious-trend-in-the-price-range-excluding-the-new-cars-have-a-higher-price.-so-the-best-prediction-in-kmeans-for-the-price-of-the-car-given-how-many-miles-driven-it-has-in-the-550-subclass-might-end-up-being-the-sample-average.}}
